**Design Document: AI-Powered CLI Todo Application**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines design options for a Command Line Interface (CLI) todo list application written in Python. The core differentiator of this application is the proposed integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities to enhance task management beyond traditional CLI tools. The goal is to create an intelligent assistant that helps users capture, understand, prioritize, break down, and reflect on their tasks directly from the terminal.

This document presents various AI-powered features as *options* for implementation. The final application might include a subset of these, based on development priorities, user value, and technical feasibility.

**2. Core Non-AI Functionality (Baseline)**

Before integrating AI, the application should possess robust core todo list features accessible via the CLI:

*   **Task Management (CRUD):**
    *   Add new tasks.
    *   List tasks (with filtering by status, priority, due date, tags/projects).
    *   Update existing tasks (description, due date, priority, status, tags).
    *   Mark tasks as complete/done.
    *   Delete tasks.
*   **Task Attributes:**
    *   Task Description (text).
    *   Status (e.g., Todo, In Progress, Done, Blocked).
    *   Priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low, or numerical).
    *   Due Date/Time (support for various date formats).
    *   Tags/Projects (for categorization, e.g., `#work`, `+projectX`).
*   **Basic Operations:**
    *   Search tasks by keyword.
    *   Sort tasks (by due date, priority, creation date).
    *   Archiving/Hiding completed tasks.

**3. AI-Powered Feature Options**

The following are optional AI-driven features that can be implemented to enhance the core functionality:

**Option 1: Natural Language Task Input & Parsing**

*   **Idea:** Allow users to add tasks using natural sentences instead of rigid command flags.
*   **AI Role:** Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) models (local like spaCy/NLTK, or cloud APIs like OpenAI/Gemini/Anthropic) to parse the input sentence. The AI would extract:
    *   Task Description
    *   Due Date/Time (interpreting phrases like "tomorrow afternoon", "next Friday", "in 2 weeks")
    *   Priority (interpreting phrases like "urgent", "important", "low priority", "!high")
    *   Tags/Projects (detecting patterns like `#tag` or `+project`)
*   **CLI Interaction Example:**
    ```bash
    todo add "Write the project report for #alpha due next Tuesday P1 !critical"
    # Or more naturally:
    todo add submit the expense report by Friday evening, it is very important

    # AI Confirmation Prompt:
    Parsed: Task='Submit the expense report', Due='YYYY-MM-DD 17:00', Priority='High'. Add? [Y/n]
    ```

**Option 2: AI Task Decomposition (Sub-task Generation)**

*   **Idea:** Help users break down large, complex, or vaguely defined tasks into smaller, actionable steps.
*   **AI Role:** Employ a generative AI model (LLM via API or local model) to analyze the main task description and suggest logical sub-tasks based on common workflows or the task's content.
*   **CLI Interaction Example:**
    ```bash
    todo add "Launch new website"
    Added task 1: Launch new website

    todo decompose 1
    # Or: todo add "Plan team offsite" --breakdown

    # AI Output:
    AI suggests the following subtasks for "Launch new website":
    1. Finalize design mockups
    2. Set up hosting environment
    3. Develop frontend components
    ... (etc.)
    Add these as subtasks? [Y/n/edit]
    ```

**Option 3: Smart Prioritization & "What Next?" Suggestion**

*   **Idea:** Provide intelligent recommendations for which task(s) to work on next, going beyond simple sorting.
*   **AI Role:** Analyze the task list considering multiple factors:
    *   Explicit priorities and due dates (urgency).
    *   Keywords in descriptions indicating importance ("urgent", "blocker", "critical").
    *   Estimated effort/time (see Option 4).
    *   Task dependencies (see Option 8).
    *   (Advanced) Learned user patterns (e.g., typical work times for specific task types, commonly postponed tasks).
    *   (Advanced) User-provided context (e.g., `todo next --focus coding --energy low`).
*   **CLI Interaction Example:**
    ```bash
    todo next
    # AI Output:
    AI Suggests Next Task: Task 5: "Refactor login module" (Priority: High, Due: EOD, Est: 1h)
    Reason: High priority, due soon, matches 'coding' focus, potentially suitable for deep work.
    Start this task? [y/N/s]kip

    todo suggest 3 # Suggest top 3
    ```

**Option 4: AI-Powered Effort/Time Estimation**

*   **Idea:** Provide automated, rough estimates for how long a task might take.
*   **AI Role:** Use an LLM or a simpler regression model trained on the user's historical task data (description + completion time, if tracked). Analyze task description keywords ("research", "write", "debug", "meeting") and complexity.
*   **CLI Interaction Example:**
    ```bash
    todo add "Debug the user authentication flow"
    Added task 2: Debug the user authentication flow

    todo estimate 2
    # AI Output:
    AI estimates task "Debug the user authentication flow" might take around 1.5 - 2.5 hours based on complexity and past debugging tasks. Set estimate? [Y/n/custom]
    ```
    *(Note: Requires a mechanism to track actual time spent, e.g., `todo start <id>`, `todo stop <id>` or manual input).*

**Option 5: Intelligent Tagging & Categorization**

*   **Idea:** Automatically suggest relevant tags or project associations when a task is added or upon request.
*   **AI Role:** Utilize NLP techniques (keyword extraction, text classification, embeddings) or an LLM to analyze the task description. Suggest tags based on keywords, semantic meaning, or common patterns learned from the user's existing tags/projects.
*   **CLI Interaction Example:**
    ```bash
    todo add "Schedule yearly review meeting with manager"
    Added Task 3: Schedule yearly review meeting with manager
    AI suggests tags: #work, #meeting, #admin. Add these tags? [Y/n/edit]

    # Or later:
    todo categorize 3
    ```

**Option 6: AI-Powered Review, Reflection & Summarization**

*   **Idea:** Generate summaries of completed work, identify productivity patterns, and nudge on stale tasks.
*   **AI Role:**
    *   **Summarization:** Use an LLM to summarize tasks completed over a specific period (day, week).
    *   **Pattern Analysis:** Analyze historical data (completion times, tags, postponements) to identify trends, productive times, or common bottlenecks.
    *   **Stale Task Nudging:** Identify long-overdue or inactive tasks and prompt the user, potentially suggesting actions (break down, rephrase, check relevance, schedule time).
*   **CLI Interaction Example:**
    ```bash
    todo summary week
    # AI Output:
    AI Weekly Summary (YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD):
    - Completed: 15 tasks (Highlights: Launched feature X, Fixed critical bug Y).
    - Overdue: 2 tasks (Task 8, Task 11).
    - Productivity Trend: Slightly higher than last week. Focus Area: #ProjectY (6 tasks).

    todo review stale
    # AI Output:
    AI Reviewing Stale Tasks (older than 2 weeks):
    - Task 7: "Organize cloud drive" (Low Prio) - Suggestion: Still relevant? Maybe schedule 30m?
    - Task 3: "Implement feature Y" (High Prio) - Suggestion: Blocked? Needs decomposition?

    todo insights
    # AI Output:
    Productivity Insights: You tend to complete 'coding' tasks faster in the mornings. Tasks tagged 'reporting' are frequently postponed.
    ```

**Option 7: Contextual Task Assistance & Resource Linking**

*   **Idea:** Connect tasks to relevant information or resources automatically or upon request.
*   **AI Role:** Analyze task description, tags, or project. Search linked local notes (e.g., Markdown files in a specific directory), potentially local file system, or use embeddings to find semantically similar past tasks or documents. Could also suggest relevant web search queries.
*   **CLI Interaction Example:**
    ```bash
    todo show 4 --context
    # AI Output:
    Task 4: Debug login issue on webapp
    Context:
    - Related File?: ~/projects/webapp/auth.py (Modified recently)
    - Related Note?: ~/Notes/webapp_auth_spec.md
    - Similar Past Task: Task 1 (Fixed session bug - Completed)
    - Suggested Search: 'common webapp login errors python flask'

    # Or on add:
    todo add "Follow up on meeting notes from yesterday's sync" --ai-context
    # AI Output:
    AI found: ~/Notes/2023-10-26-SyncNotes.md. Link to task? [y/N]
    ```
    *(Note: Requires configuration for searchable locations and potentially indexing for performance).*

**Option 8: Dependency Detection & Management**

*   **Idea:** Help users identify and manage dependencies between tasks.
*   **AI Role:** Analyze task descriptions for explicit mentions ("waiting for", "blocked by", "after X") or use semantic similarity (embeddings) to find tasks that seem logically connected (e.g., "Implement feature X" and "Write tests for feature X"). Suggest linking them. Warn if starting a task whose prerequisite is incomplete.
*   **CLI Interaction Example:**
    ```bash
    todo add "Analyze user feedback"
    Added Task 5: Analyze user feedback
    AI Suggestion: This task might depend on Task 2 ('Collect user feedback'). Create dependency? [Y/n]

    todo start 5 # Assuming Task 2 is not done and dependency exists
    # AI Warning:
    Hold on! Task 2 ('Collect user feedback'), which is a prerequisite, is not yet complete.
    ```

**Option 9: Focus Mode Assistance**

*   **Idea:** Integrate AI suggestions with a focus timer (e.g., Pomodoro).
*   **AI Role:** Before starting a focus session, suggest a specific task based on priority, estimated time matching the session length, and maybe current context.
*   **CLI Interaction Example:**
    ```bash
    todo focus 25 # Start a 25-minute timer
    # AI Output:
    Okay, focusing for 25 minutes.
    Suggestion: Work on 'Draft introduction for blog post' (Est: ~20 mins, Prio: Med). Start? [Y/n]
    ```

**Option 10: Motivational / Anti-Procrastination Nudges**

*   **Idea:** Provide gentle encouragement or suggestions when tasks are repeatedly deferred or marked as "stuck".
*   **AI Role:** Detect patterns of procrastination for specific tasks or task types. Use an LLM (potentially with a specific "coach" persona) to offer tips, suggest breaking down the task (linking to Option 2), or help reframe it positively.
*   **CLI Interaction Example:**
    ```bash
    # Proactive prompt:
    AI Notice: Task 'Clean the garage' has been postponed 3 times. Feeling stuck? Perhaps schedule just 15 minutes to start? Or break it down? [Breakdown/Schedule/Ignore]

    todo motivate <task_id> # User explicitly asks for help
    # AI Output:
    AI Coach: Getting started on 'Write final essay' can feel tough! How about just outlining the main sections for 10 minutes? That often makes the rest feel easier.
    ```

**4. Technical Considerations**

*   **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
*   **CLI Framework:** `click`, `typer`, or `argparse`. (`typer` or `click` recommended for richer features).
*   **Terminal Output:** `rich` library for enhanced formatting (colors, tables, markdown, spinners, progress bars).
*   **Interactive Prompts:** `questionary` or `prompt_toolkit` for interactive selections (e.g., choosing sub-tasks).
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Simple: JSON or YAML file(s).
    *   Robust: SQLite database (using `sqlite3` standard library).
*   **AI Integration:**
    *   **Cloud APIs:** Use libraries like `openai`, `google-generativeai`, `anthropic`. Requires managing API keys securely (env variables, config file, system keyring) and internet access. Consider potential costs and data privacy implications.
    *   **Local Models:** Use libraries like `ctransformers`, `llama-cpp-python`, integrated via tools like `ollama` or `LM Studio`. Offers better privacy and offline capability but requires more setup, potentially powerful hardware for good performance, and may yield less capable results than top-tier APIs.
    *   **NLP Libraries:** `spaCy` or `NLTK` for specific NLP tasks (parsing, NER, keyword extraction) locally.
    *   **Embeddings:** `sentence-transformers` for local semantic similarity calculations.
    *   **Frameworks:** Consider `LangChain` or `LlamaIndex` for managing complex AI workflows, prompts, and data connections.
*   **Configuration:** Use a configuration file (e.g., `~/.config/ai-todo/config.yaml`) for API keys, model preferences, default settings, paths for contextual search, etc.
*   **Performance & UX:**
    *   AI calls can be slow; use asynchronous operations (`asyncio`, `aiohttp`/`httpx`) for API calls.
    *   Provide visual feedback (e.g., spinners from `rich`) during AI processing.
    *   AI features should ideally be optional or fail gracefully if AI is unavailable/misconfigured.
    *   Always allow user confirmation/override for AI-suggested changes.
*   **Privacy:** Be transparent about what data (task descriptions) is sent to external services if using cloud APIs. Offer local model options as a privacy-preserving alternative.

**5. Development Approach (Recommendation)**

1.  **Build the Core:** Implement the non-AI baseline functionality first. Ensure it's stable and usable.
2.  **Iterate on AI:** Select one high-value, relatively simple AI feature (e.g., Natural Language Input Parsing or Smart Prioritization) to implement first.
3.  **Modular Integration:** Design the AI components modularly, allowing them to be enabled/disabled via configuration or command flags.
4.  **Gather Feedback:** If possible, get user feedback on the usefulness and interaction patterns of the AI features.
5.  **Expand Gradually:** Add further AI options based on feedback, complexity, and perceived value.
