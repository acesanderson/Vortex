# Vortex Architecture & Separation of Concerns Design Document

## System Overview: Siphon â†” Vortex Separation

### Core Architectural Principle
**Siphon**: Passive intelligence and content discovery
**Vortex**: Active task management and productivity environment

This separation follows classic software architecture patterns:
- **Data Layer** (Siphon): Ingestion, processing, analysis, pattern recognition
- **Application Layer** (Vortex): User interaction, task lifecycle, productivity workflows

## Vortex: The Active Productivity Cockpit

### Primary Responsibilities

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Active Task Management**
- **Manual todo creation** via CLI with rich syntax parsing
- **Task lifecycle management** (TODO â†’ IN PROGRESS â†’ BLOCKED â†’ DONE)
- **Real-time interaction** with your current work context
- **Immediate feedback loops** for productivity decisions

#### ðŸ”„ **Productivity Environment**
- **CLI while-loop interface** for sustained focus sessions
- **Context switching** between different work modes
- **Interactive task triage** from Siphon discoveries
- **Real-time status updates** and progress tracking

#### ðŸ“Š **Query & Categorization Engine**
- **Advanced filtering** by status, priority, tags, projects
- **Smart search** across tasks and context
- **Custom views** for different work contexts (coding, meetings, admin)
- **Reporting** on active work patterns

### Software Architecture Analysis

#### âœ… **Why This Separation Makes Sense**

**1. Single Responsibility Principle**
- **Siphon**: "I find and understand todos across your knowledge base"
- **Vortex**: "I help you actively manage and complete tasks right now"

**2. Temporal Boundaries**
- **Siphon**: Batch processing, periodic scans, historical analysis
- **Vortex**: Real-time interaction, immediate responses, active sessions

**3. User Interface Optimization**
- **Siphon**: Background processing, minimal UI (server/API focused)
- **Vortex**: Rich CLI experience, interactive workflows, human-optimized

**4. Data Flow Clarity**
```
[Knowledge Base] â†’ [Siphon Discovery] â†’ [Vortex Triage] â†’ [Active Work] â†’ [Completion] â†’ [Siphon Analytics]
```

**5. Scaling Characteristics**
- **Siphon**: Heavy computational load, can run on dedicated server
- **Vortex**: Lightweight, responsive, local interaction

## Vortex Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **CLI Interface Layer**
```python
class VortexCLI:
    """Primary user interface - optimized for speed and natural interaction"""
    
    def quick_add(self, task_input: str):
        """Natural language task creation with instant feedback"""
        
    def interactive_session(self):
        """While-loop productivity environment"""
        
    def query_tasks(self, filters: dict):
        """Advanced search and filtering"""
        
    def triage_siphon_discoveries(self):
        """Review and import Siphon-discovered todos"""
```

#### 2. **Task Lifecycle Engine**
```python
class TaskManager:
    """Handles active task state management"""
    
    def create_task(self, parsed_input: Task) -> UUID:
        """Create new task with rich metadata"""
        
    def update_status(self, task_id: UUID, status: Status):
        """Real-time status transitions"""
        
    def start_focus_session(self, task_id: UUID):
        """Begin active work tracking"""
        
    def batch_operations(self, task_ids: list[UUID], operation: str):
        """Bulk task management"""
```

#### 3. **Productivity Session Manager**
```python
class ProductivitySession:
    """Manages focused work periods and context switching"""
    
    def start_session(self, duration: int, focus_area: str):
        """Begin timed focus session with context"""
        
    def suggest_next_task(self, context: WorkContext):
        """AI-powered task suggestion for current session"""
        
    def handle_interruptions(self, interruption_type: str):
        """Graceful handling of context switches"""
```

#### 4. **Siphon Integration Layer**
```python
class SiphonConnector:
    """Handles bidirectional sync with Siphon discovery engine"""
    
    def fetch_discovered_todos(self) -> list[ToDoMetadata]:
        """Pull new todos discovered by Siphon"""
        
    def sync_completion_status(self, completions: list[UUID]):
        """Report completed tasks back to Siphon"""
        
    def request_contextual_analysis(self, task: Task) -> AnalysisResult:
        """Leverage Siphon's AI for task insights"""
```

### User Experience Design

#### CLI While-Loop Productivity Environment
```bash
# Enter Vortex productivity mode
$ vortex session

Welcome to Vortex Productivity Session
Current context: coding | energy: high | time: 09:30

[3 active tasks, 7 pending from Siphon]

> suggest next
AI: Based on your context, try "Refactor auth module" (Est: 45min, High priority)
Start this task? [y/N/list/context]: y

> focus 45
Starting 45-minute focus session on "Refactor auth module"
Timer: 44:32 remaining | Status: IN_PROGRESS
Break for interruption? [q/pause/status]: 

> status
Active: Refactor auth module (IN_PROGRESS, 12min elapsed)
Queue: 2 tasks | Siphon discoveries: 7 pending review
Context: deep work | No interruptions requested

> pause
Session paused. Resume with 'continue' or switch context with 'context'

> context admin
Switching to admin context...
Available admin tasks: [Review expense reports, Schedule 1:1s, Update project docs]

> quick add "Email team about holiday schedule" -p high #admin
Added: Email team about holiday schedule (HIGH, #admin)

> list #admin
Admin Tasks:
1. [ ] Email team about holiday schedule (HIGH) - just added
2. [ ] Review expense reports (MED) - due Friday
3. [ ] Schedule 1:1s (LOW) - this week

> complete 1
âœ“ Completed: Email team about holiday schedule
Syncing with Siphon... âœ“

> exit
Session summary: 47min focused work, 1 task completed, 1 task added
```

#### Natural Language Task Creation
```bash
# Vortex's strength: instant, natural task capture
$ todo "follow up with sarah about the api changes, high priority, blocked on her response"

Parsed: 
- Task: "Follow up with Sarah about API changes"
- Priority: HIGH  
- Status: BLOCKED
- Context: "waiting on her response"
- Tags: [api, communication]

Add task? [Y/n]: y
âœ“ Added task #47 | Set reminder for 2 days? [y/N]: y
```

#### Siphon Discovery Triage
```bash
$ vortex review

Siphon discovered 12 new todos. Review for import:

1. "TODO: Add error handling to payment flow" 
   Source: /code/payments.py | Context: code | Est: 1h
   Import? [y/N/skip]: y

2. "Follow up on budget meeting notes"
   Source: /notes/2024-01-15.md | Context: admin | Est: 15min  
   Import? [y/N/skip]: y

3. "Buy groceries - milk, bread, eggs"
   Source: /notes/daily.md | Context: personal | Est: 30min
   Import? [y/N/skip]: n

Imported 2/3 discoveries. Run 'vortex list' to see active tasks.
```

## Data Architecture & Integration

### Shared Data Layer
```python
# PostgreSQL schema shared between Siphon and Vortex
class SharedTask(BaseModel):
    id: UUID
    source: Literal["siphon_discovered", "vortex_created", "vortex_imported"]
    siphon_metadata: Optional[ToDoMetadata]  # Rich discovery context
    vortex_metadata: Optional[VortexTaskData]  # Active management data
    sync_status: SyncStatus
```

### Integration Patterns

#### 1. **Discovery â†’ Triage â†’ Action**
```python
# Siphon discovers â†’ Vortex imports â†’ User acts
discovered_todo = siphon.discover_todo(content)  # Background process
vortex.present_for_triage(discovered_todo)       # User interaction
vortex.create_active_task(discovered_todo)       # Task activation
```

#### 2. **Completion Feedback Loop**
```python
# Vortex completion â†’ Siphon learning
vortex.complete_task(task_id)                    # User action
siphon.record_completion(task_id, completion_context)  # Analytics update
siphon.update_ai_models(completion_pattern)     # Learning feedback
```

#### 3. **Contextual Intelligence**
```python
# Vortex requests â†’ Siphon provides insights
context = vortex.get_current_work_context()     # What user is doing now
suggestions = siphon.analyze_context(context)   # AI-powered insights
vortex.present_suggestions(suggestions)         # User-friendly display
```

## System Benefits of This Architecture

### ðŸŽ¯ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **Vortex never does content discovery** - focuses purely on active management
- **Siphon never does real-time interaction** - focuses purely on intelligence
- **Clean data contracts** between systems

### âš¡ **Performance Optimization**
- **Vortex optimized for responsiveness** - immediate CLI feedback
- **Siphon optimized for thoroughness** - deep content analysis
- **Independent scaling** - can optimize each system separately

### ðŸ§  **ADHD-Friendly Design**
- **Vortex provides immediate gratification** - quick task capture, instant feedback
- **Siphon provides background intelligence** - no cognitive overhead for discovery
- **Seamless context switching** - Vortex handles interruption patterns

### ðŸ”„ **Natural Workflow Integration**
```
Daily Flow:
1. Work on code â†’ Vortex suggests code-related tasks
2. Complete tasks â†’ Siphon learns completion patterns  
3. Meeting ends â†’ Siphon discovers action items â†’ Vortex presents for triage
4. Context switch â†’ Vortex adapts interface to new context
5. End of day â†’ Siphon analyzes patterns â†’ Vortex shows tomorrow's suggestions
```

The key insight is that these are fundamentally different problems requiring different solutions, but with enormous synergy when properly integrated.

# Old README
This is a command line-based todo app inspired by linux pass and my llm scripts (like leviathan, tutorialize, ask, twig, etc.)

Motivation for this project:
- todo apps on the command line have existed for a long time, as well as implementations that store in a text-based format.
- my experience with the Mentor project showed the benefit of building my work environment as I do my daily work.
- I want to scale this idea to how I store, take notes, and complete tasks more broadly. Obsidian can be the GUI counterpart to this, and implementation is trivial given Obsidian being a wrapper around text files.
- This is "building the airplane as we are flying it" and a new approach to work. The idea here is that I spend 20% of my work day editing my work environment, with outsize performance benefits of 50%.

### Metalearning goals
- productivity theory, particulary in relation to what "works" for me -- i.e. NOT GTD, but zettelkasten/obsidian
 - lean into the WHY of certain tasks that get delayed or not completed
- click CLI framework

### Use cases
- command line:
 - create a task: `todo follow up with Zapier -p ! -s blocked`
 - create a task (NLP): `todo follow up with zapier, high priority, blocked, before next Tuesday`
- shell: every command available that you have through `todo ____` on command line
 - advanced commands like building projects, adding / accessing documents
- obsidian: rework todo in main todo (changes in that markdown file get realized in database); work with daily mds as well
- ad hoc scripting: attaching work flows / data flows etc. into the mix; importing todo list into various convenience functions + AI implementations 

### Architecture
- python package (with setup.py entry points)
- postgres backend (for saving tasks, metadata, and everything else)
- markdown file in obsidian vault. A main todo file mirrors tasks saved in postgres; allows for manual editing of the todo list. Can contain hidden uuids. Other markdown files keyed to particular days can be pre-populated.
- vector document store in the backend (postgres or chroma)

### Task creation syntax
task: natural language
tag: #work
project: +project
status: -s
- todo (default if not specified)
- doing or in-progress
- blocked / waiting for
- done or completed
priority: -p l/m/h OR ! !! !!!
date: -d YYYY-MM-DD
